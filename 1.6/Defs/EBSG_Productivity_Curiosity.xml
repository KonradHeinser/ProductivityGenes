        <description>Carriers of this gene are incapable of wanting to discover new things, preferring to utilize what is already known.\n\nThis will not impact their learning rate, just make researching new things impossible for them. To ensure the pawn can still produce drugs, intellectual work is not disabled.\n\nFor more options involving the rate a pawn learns, take a look at More Study Genes. You can use those to alter how well a pawn can better themselves.</description>
